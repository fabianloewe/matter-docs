# Type definition

Let's start with the first line:

```ruby
ForLoop < Statement:
```

If you are familiar with Ruby you might have an idea what this means.

Does it derive the type `ForLoop` from `Statement`? Yes, it does.

`ForLoop` is called the _descendant_ while `Statement` is its _ancestor_. Coming from Ruby or Python you might call them child and parent but these words have a different meaning in Matter which we will explain at next.

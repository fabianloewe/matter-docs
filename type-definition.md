# Matter definition

Let's start with the first line:

```ruby
ForLoop < Statement:
```

If you are familiar with Ruby you might have an idea what this means.

Does it derive the type `ForLoop` from `Statement`? Yes, it does but like you have read in the caption, we simply call it _matter_ or _matter type_. The reason for this is, types are already some kind of matter while for example `Statement` is something different.

`ForLoop` is called the _descendant_ while `Statement` is its _ancestor_. Coming from Ruby or Python you might call them child and parent but these words have a different meaning in Matter which we will explain at next.

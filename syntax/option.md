### Option

```ruby
example = "Hello world" [ "!" ]
```

**Symbol:** Square brackets \(`[` and `]`\)

**Operation: **The part between the square brackets can exist but doesn't have to. In the example above this means the string `Hello world` is expected first then `!` can immediately follow. So `Hello world` and `Hello world!` are both valid.

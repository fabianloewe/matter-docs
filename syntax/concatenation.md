## Concatenation

A _concatenation_ appends one rule to another. This means that to be valid, the first rule must be parsed followed by the second one immediately.

**Symbol: **Whitespace

#### Example

```ruby
example = "Hello world" "!"
```

In the example above this means the string `Hello world` is expected first then `!` must immediately follow.

**Invalid strin**

## Definition

A _definition_ is a grammatical rule assigned to variable. The variable name can only consist of lowercase letters, numbers and dashes \(`-`\).

#### Example

```ruby
example = "Hello world"
```

In this example the variable `example` defines a rule which is only valid if the string `Hello world` is parsed.

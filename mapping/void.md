## Void

The `Void` is the type for specifing emptiness. It has one value: `void`. You will usually only face it when you have to deal with an [`Optional`](/mapping/option.md) which we examine later. This means you **cannot** create it somehow by yourself.

### Examples

##### **Definition:**

```ruby
example = void    # Illegal in real code
```

This would explicitly define `example` to be nothing, empty, `void`. The problem is you could not do anything with this variable which is the reason why the compiler will complain about it in real code.
